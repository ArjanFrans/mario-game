==========

A clone of Super Mario Bros. 16-bit version game.

### About
This game is based of the Super Mario Bros. 16-bit version featured on Super Mario All-Starts for the SNES. The game is written in Java an using the [LibGdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) engine.

### Changes
* The project is updated to work with the new LibGdx release which uses Gradle.
* I am no longer updating the game. I finished some last pieces to make the level start over at the end... with some pretty ugly fixes.
